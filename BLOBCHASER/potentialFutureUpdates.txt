// Ideas, for a future update of BLOBCHASER.

- Use textWidth() to align text better.
- Use distance() instead of mouseX & mouseY for better hit detection.
- Add function clutchTime(): In the last x seconds:
--- Rapidly change background color.
--- Increase frameRate() so that target moves faster.
--- Increase the score for each hit.
